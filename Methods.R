##TODO: Analysis Steps:
#1. Perform descriptive statistics to provide a description of income and pollution in your study site.
#2. Perform an analysis to determine if there exists significant income segregation in your study site.
#3. Determine if the spatial variability in pollution level explains the spatial variability in income or visa versa. Evaluate any assumptions for conducting this analysis, ensuring that assumptions are not erroneously violated. 
#4. Evaluate the sampling structure of the pollution sample by determining if they are randomly located across the study site or not.

# keep methods description concise -> use previous assignments! BUT ONLY WHAT IS USEFUL FOR THIS PAPER
# use graphs and figures to describe, keep word count for discussion!!
# avoid language about hypothesis in a project like this
